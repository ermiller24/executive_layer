### Notes:
- The implementation follows the design document's flow
- The Executive LLM can interrupt or restart the Speaker LLM based on its evaluation
- The Vector Store provides context for the Speaker LLM
- The Neo4j knowledge graph provides information for the Executive LLM
- All components are packaged behind an OpenAI-compatible API
- No extensions have been implemented as decisions are still pending
- The API supports all critical OpenAI features: tool calling, JSON mode, and streaming
- The Makefile makes it easy to deploy and manage the system with simple commands
- The Python chatbot provides an easy way to test and demonstrate the system
- File processing and vision capabilities are not currently implemented
- The system now supports different model providers through initChatModel
- The Neo4j knowledge graph is now implemented as tool calls bound to the LLM
- The Executive LLM can now directly interact with the knowledge graph through tool calls
- The knowledge graph structure follows the reference implementation
- The credential management system allows for flexible deployment scenarios:
  - Default credentials can be set in the .env file for easy deployment
  - Credentials can be overridden at runtime for testing different models/providers
  - The Python chatbot supports command-line arguments for credential overrides
- Current implementation status:
  - The system currently uses mock responses instead of actual LLM calls
  - Embeddings endpoint works structurally but returns mock data
  - Chat completions return static hardcoded responses
  - Error handling has been improved but could be enhanced further
  - The system passes basic tests but does not provide actual LLM functionality
  - The Neo4j database is now accessible on non-standard ports to avoid conflicts
  - All Docker containers have the necessary dependencies for native module compilation
  - The "redeploy" make target simplifies the development workflow

### Testing Instructions:
1. Set up environment variables in .env file
2. Run `make deploy` to build and start all services
3. Run `make test` to verify API functionality
4. Run `make chatbot` to start the Python chatbot for interactive testing
5. Test with real OpenAI API clients by pointing them to http://localhost:3000
6. Use `make logs` to view logs from all services
7. Use `make stop` to stop all services when done

  - Created mock speaker outputs with known correct and incorrect information
  - Added simulated streaming test with progressive incorrect information
  - Added test for the restart functionality with completely off-topic responses
  - Included an optional integration test with the actual speaker API
  - This approach is more reliable as it doesn't depend on LLMs generating incorrect information

## 2025-03-07 (Night)
- Fixed streaming restart functionality in speaker service:
  - Previously, when the executive requested a restart during streaming, the speaker would stop the stream but not start a new one
  - Now, the speaker properly creates a new set of messages with the knowledge document

## 2025-03-12
- Added Extended Response Mode design to design.txt:
  - Documented the concept, features, and implementation approach
  - Clarified how it integrates with the existing Executive Layer architecture
  - Specified the API extension mechanism using the `extended_thread_id` parameter

### Extended Response Mode Implementation Plan:

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Create thread storage mechanism:
   - Implement a ThreadManager class to store and retrieve conversation threads
   - Add methods for creating, updating, and retrieving threads by ID
   - Implement thread expiration/cleanup mechanism to prevent memory leaks
   - Add thread metadata tracking (creation time, last access, message count)

2. Modify API endpoint to support extended mode:
   - Update the chat completions endpoint to recognize the `extended_thread_id` parameter
   - Add logic to retrieve existing thread history when an ID is provided
   - Implement message appending for incremental updates
   - Add validation for thread IDs and message formats

#### Phase 2: Executive-First Flow
3. Implement executive-first planning:
   - Create a new endpoint in the executive service for generating response plans
   - Modify the extended mode flow to have the executive create a plan before the speaker responds
   - Ensure the progress document is created with the detailed plan
   - Only allow the speaker to begin responding after the plan is created

4. Create progress tracking system:
   - Implement a ProgressTracker class for the executive layer
   - Add methods to create, update, and read progress documents
   - Create file storage for progress documents (one per thread)
   - Implement logic to replace executive history with progress document references

#### Phase 3: Context Management
5. Implement dynamic summarization:
   - Create a function to measure context window utilization
   - Add a threshold trigger for when summarization should occur
   - Implement the summarization logic in the executive layer
   - Ensure the most recent N messages are preserved intact
   - Replace older messages with the generated summary

6. Disable vector store in extended mode:
   - Add a flag to bypass vector store operations when in extended mode
   - Update the speaker service to check this flag before vector store operations
   - Ensure knowledge documents are still properly managed by the executive

#### Phase 4: Integration and Optimization
7. Implement thread persistence:
   - Add database storage for threads to survive service restarts
   - Implement thread serialization/deserialization
   - Add configuration options for persistence settings

8. Add monitoring and diagnostics:
   - Create endpoints to view active threads and their status
   - Add metrics for thread usage, summarization frequency, and context utilization
   - Implement logging for extended mode operations

#### Phase 5: Testing and Documentation
9. Create comprehensive tests:
   - Unit tests for ThreadManager and ProgressTracker
   - Integration tests for the extended mode API
   - Performance tests for long-running conversations
   - Edge case tests for context window management

10. Update documentation:
    - Add extended mode section to README.md
    - Create EXTENDED_MODE.md with detailed documentation
    - Update API documentation to include the new parameter
    - Add examples of extended mode usage

### Implementation Notes:
- The extended mode should be completely optional and not affect normal API usage
- Thread storage should be memory-efficient to handle many concurrent threads
- Summarization should be intelligent enough to preserve important context
- Progress tracking should be robust against failures and provide clear status information
- The implementation should follow the existing architectural patterns
- Extended mode should work seamlessly with all existing features (tool calling, JSON mode, etc.)
- The executive-first flow is critical for complex, long-running tasks
- The progress document serves as both a planning tool and a reference for the executive

## 2025-03-12 (Afternoon)
- Updated Extended Response Mode design in design.txt:
  - Added detailed description of the executive-first flow
  - Clarified the role of the progress document in planning and tracking
  - Added implementation flow section with step-by-step process
  - Included example use cases for extended mode

- Revised implementation plan in progress.txt:
  - Added a new phase for executive-first planning
  - Reorganized tasks to prioritize the executive-first flow
  - Added more detailed notes on the importance of this approach

- Next steps:
  1. ✅ Implement the core infrastructure (ThreadManager, ProgressTracker)
  2. ✅ Create the executive-first planning endpoint
  3. ✅ Modify the extended mode flow to follow the new design
  4. ✅ Implement context management and summarization

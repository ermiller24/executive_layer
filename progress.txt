# Executive Interrupting Rectifier (EIR) - Progress Log

## 2025-03-05
- Analyzed design document and understood project requirements
- Created basic project structure
- Created docker-compose.yml with services for:
  - API (OpenAI-compatible bridge)
  - Speaker LLM
  - Executive LLM
  - Vector Store
  - Neo4j (knowledge graph)
- Implemented core components:
  - OpenAI-compatible API bridge (server.js, chat.js, embedding.js)
  - Speaker LLM service
  - Executive LLM service with knowledge graph integration
  - Vector Store service
- Added support for critical OpenAI API features:
  - Tool calling (both streaming and non-streaming)
  - Structured JSON output (response_format parameter)
  - Streaming (already implemented)
- Created Dockerfiles for all services
- Created test script (test_api.js) to verify API functionality, including tests for:
  - Basic chat completions
  - Embeddings
  - Streaming
  - Tool calling
  - Streaming tool calling
  - JSON mode
- Created comprehensive README.md with documentation and instructions
- Added Makefile with common commands for easier deployment and management:
  - make deploy - Build and start all services
  - make stop - Stop all services
  - make restart - Restart all services
  - make logs - View logs from all services
  - make test - Run the test script
  - make clean - Remove containers and volumes
  - make build - Build all Docker images
  - make status - Check the status of all services
  - make install - Install Node.js dependencies
  - make dev - Start services in development mode
- Implemented Python chatbot for easy testing and demonstration:
  - Uses Langchain to connect to the EIR system
  - Supports both langchain-openai and openlm integrations
  - Provides a simple command-line interface
  - Streams responses in real-time
  - Added make commands for Python environment setup and chatbot execution
- Updated Speaker and Executive services to use initChatModel:
  - Replaced direct ChatOpenAI instantiation with initChatModel
  - Added support for different model providers (not just OpenAI)
  - Updated environment variables to include model provider and API base options
  - Updated docker-compose.yml to pass the new environment variables
- Refactored Neo4j implementation to align with reference implementation:
  - Created Neo4jManager class in knowledge/neo4j-manager.js
  - Exposed Neo4j functionality as tool calls in knowledge/knowledge-tools.js
  - Updated executive service to use knowledge tools instead of direct Neo4j interactions
  - Bound knowledge tools to the LLM for direct interaction with the knowledge graph
  - Implemented proper schema initialization for Neo4j
  - Added support for creating nodes, edges, altering nodes, and searching the graph
- Implemented credential management system:
  - Added support for loading default credentials from environment variables
  - Added ability to override credentials at runtime via API headers
  - Updated API server to pass credentials to Speaker and Executive services
  - Updated Vector Store service to accept API keys for embedding generation
  - Updated Python chatbot to support command-line arguments for credential overrides
  - Added clear documentation of credential options in README.md

### Next Steps:
1. Test the API bridge individually
2. Test the Speaker LLM service
3. Test the Executive LLM service
4. Test the Vector Store service
5. Test the integrated system
6. Add error handling and logging
7. Optimize performance

### Future Enhancements:
1. Add support for file processing and vision capabilities:
   - Update API bridge to handle file uploads and attachments in chat completions
   - Modify Speaker service to process files if the backend LLM supports it
   - Update streaming implementation to handle file-related responses
   - Add file handling to the Python chatbot
2. Implement the extensions mentioned in the design document:
   - Managed Docker instance for sandboxed computations
   - Automatic prompt extension for longer conversations
   - Different models for Speaker and Executive
   - Multiple Executive models running simultaneously

### Notes:
- The implementation follows the design document's flow
- The Executive LLM can interrupt or restart the Speaker LLM based on its evaluation
- The Vector Store provides context for the Speaker LLM
- The Neo4j knowledge graph provides information for the Executive LLM
- All components are packaged behind an OpenAI-compatible API
- No extensions have been implemented as decisions are still pending
- The API supports all critical OpenAI features: tool calling, JSON mode, and streaming
- The Makefile makes it easy to deploy and manage the system with simple commands
- The Python chatbot provides an easy way to test and demonstrate the system
- File processing and vision capabilities are not currently implemented
- The system now supports different model providers through initChatModel
- The Neo4j knowledge graph is now implemented as tool calls bound to the LLM
- The Executive LLM can now directly interact with the knowledge graph through tool calls
- The knowledge graph structure follows the reference implementation
- The credential management system allows for flexible deployment scenarios:
  - Default credentials can be set in the .env file for easy deployment
  - Credentials can be overridden at runtime for testing different models/providers
  - The Python chatbot supports command-line arguments for credential overrides

### Testing Instructions:
1. Set up environment variables in .env file
2. Run `make deploy` to build and start all services
3. Run `make test` to verify API functionality
4. Run `make chatbot` to start the Python chatbot for interactive testing
5. Test with real OpenAI API clients by pointing them to http://localhost:3000
6. Use `make logs` to view logs from all services
7. Use `make stop` to stop all services when done
